This app is being developed so that you can post a shift that needs
to be covered at work and someone else can go and claim that shift to 
take.

Once the shift has been took than the appropriate people are emailed.
One is always send to the person incharge of the schedule and two other
emails are sent: one to the person that posted the shift and the other
to the person that took the shift.
